// Write a program that reads input a word at a time until a lone q is entered.
// The program should then report the number of words that began with vowels,
// the number that began with consonants, and the number that fit neither of
// those categories. One approach is to use isalpha() to discriminate between
// words beginning with letters and those that donâ€™t and then use an if or
// switch statement to further identify those passing the isalpha() test that
// begin with vowels. A sample run might look like this:
// => Enter words (q to quit):
// => The 12 awesome oxen ambled
// => quietly across 15 meters of lawn. q
// => 5 words beginning with vowels
// => 4 words beginning with consonants
// => 2 others
